## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- BEM naming conventions
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I remember reading online about an HTML5 element that accomplished an accordion without the need for JavaScript, so I researched this and came across the `<details>` and `<summary>` tags.

### Useful resources

- [How to hide the default details ::marker](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56758098/how-to-position-detail-marker-to-come-after-summary) - This helped me find the marker pseudo-selector, hide the default marker, and add my own dropdown arrow from the design.
